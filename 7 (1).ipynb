    "Features commonly present in wine quality datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed acidity: This refers to the non-volatile acids present in wine, which contribute to its overall acidity. Acidity affects the taste, balance, and preservation of wine, making it an essential parameter for quality assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatile acidity: Volatile acids can negatively impact the wine's aroma and flavor. High levels of volatile acidity can lead to a vinegar-like taste, indicating poor quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Citric acid: This is another form of acidity found in wine, but it is usually more pleasant than volatile acidity. Citric acid can enhance the wine's freshness and add a tangy character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual sugar: The residual sugar content is the amount of sugar left in the wine after fermentation. It plays a significant role in determining the wine's sweetness level, with well-balanced sweetness being desirable for some wine types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chlorides: Chlorides, often measured as sodium chloride, can influence the wine's saltiness. In moderation, they can enhance the wine's complexity, but excessive levels might negatively impact the taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free sulfur dioxide: Sulfur dioxide is used as a preservative in wine. The free form of sulfur dioxide is essential for preventing oxidation and microbial growth, affecting the wine's stability and longevity."

    "Handling missing data is essential because many machine learning algorithms cannot handle NaN (Not a Number) values. There are several techniques for imputing missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean/Median/Mode Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: Simple and easy to implement. It replaces missing values with the mean (for numerical data), median (for skewed data), or mode (for categorical data) of the available data.\n",
    "Disadvantage: Can lead to biased estimates, especially if the missing data is not missing completely at random. It can also underestimate the variability in the data.\n",
    "Random Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: Introduces randomness, which can help reduce bias in the imputed values.\n",
    "Disadvantage: Random imputation might not reflect the true distribution of the data, leading to less accurate results.\n",
    "Hot-Deck Imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: This method selects a similar record from the available data (based on some similarity measure) to impute the missing value, leading to more realistic imputations.\n",
    "Disadvantage: Can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets, and may not handle high-dimensional data well"

    "The factors that affect students' performance in exams are multifaceted and can be influenced by various individual, socio-economic, and educational aspects. Some of the key factors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Habits: The quality and consistency of students' study habits play a significant role in their exam performance. Factors like time management, study techniques, and focus on understanding the material can impact their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior Knowledge and Ability: Students' previous knowledge and academic ability in the subject matter can influence their performance. Strong foundations in relevant topics contribute to better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation and Engagement: Students who are motivated and engaged in their studies are more likely to perform well in exams. On the other hand, lack of interest or external pressures can negatively affect performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parental Support and Socio-Economic Status: Supportive family environments and higher socio-economic status can provide access to resources, such as tutoring or educational materials, which can impact exam performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classroom Environment and Teaching Quality: The quality of teaching, classroom environment, and availability of resources at the educational institution can influence students' understanding of the subject matter."

    "Shapiro-Wilk Test:\n",
    "Perform the Shapiro-Wilk test, a statistical test to assess normality. It provides a p-value, and if it is less than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis of normality"
